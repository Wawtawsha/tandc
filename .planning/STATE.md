# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Store-brand-primary identity chosen (avoids La-Z-Boy vs Ashley color clash)
- Clone from Shrike template (proven production codebase)
- Hardcoded content over CMS for v1
- Free font alternatives over licensed brand fonts
- useReducedMotion rewritten to useSyncExternalStore for React 19 compliance
- useScrollReveal refactored to derive visibility instead of setState in effect
- Footer rendered as server component (no client-side state needed for currentYear)
- Store hours and footer links hardcoded inline for v1 simplicity
- Display font applied to footer headings via inline style for consistency
- Phone number (434) 223-8163 added as primary CTA in navigation header
- Mobile menu auto-closes on route change via useEffect pathname dependency
- scroll-padding-top: 5rem prevents sticky nav from obscuring anchor targets
- Phone number placed after nav links in desktop, separated by border in mobile

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Some product-specific content (exact best sellers, store history, staff photos) requires client input
- La-Z-Boy dealer brand guidelines not fully known -- may need to verify required badge usage
